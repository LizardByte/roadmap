# LizardByte Roadmap

This repository tracks the strategic roadmap for LizardByte projects across all our organizations.
The roadmap consists of GitHub issues that outline future plans, improvements, and milestones for our projects.

## Purpose

This central roadmap repository helps us:
- Coordinate development efforts across multiple repositories
- Track dependencies between projects
- Provide transparency about our development direction
- Clearly describe ideas and goals about our projects, and make it easier for new contributors to get involved

## How It Works

Roadmap items are maintained as GitHub issues in this repository. Each item includes:
- Target repositories
- Languages/Skills/Technologies involved
- Detailed description
- Estimated effort
- Priority level
- Milestone estimate
- Dependencies

> [!NOTE]  
> LizardByte projects are maintained by volunteers.
> The roadmap is not a guarantee of future work, but rather a guide to our current priorities and goals.
