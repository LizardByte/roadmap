# LizardByte Roadmap

This repository tracks the strategic roadmap for LizardByte projects across all our organizations.
The roadmap consists of GitHub issues that outline future plans, improvements, and milestones for our projects.

## Purpose

This central roadmap repository helps us:
- Coordinate development efforts across multiple repositories
- Establish clear priorities and timelines
- Track dependencies between projects
- Provide transparency about our development direction

## How It Works

Roadmap items are maintained as GitHub issues in this repository. Each item includes:
- Target repositories
- Priority level
- Timeline expectations

## For Team Members

To add a new roadmap item:
1. Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues)
2. Click "New Issue"

The repository list in the issue template is automatically updated daily with all active repositories across
the LizardByte organizations.
